#Question 1d

#Efficeny of your program code:

#My program is efficent as I have used loops so my 
#total number of lines of code is less. I have also
#used if and elif statments so I can test multiple 
#diffrent conditions while not uesing many lines of 
#code.

#Robustness of your compleated program

#My program is robust as I have used input validation so
#that only accepted values can be used in the program.
